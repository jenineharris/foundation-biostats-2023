# FIX IT! Chapter 3 exercises 

This code is broken. Let's fix it.

```{r openPackages}
# load the tidyverse
library(package = "tidyverse")
```

The codebook for the 2011-2012 NHANES is on the CDC website: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2011

```{r importData}
# 1) Income

# import the data (from local file, faster)
# uncomment next line to use this method to open
# nhanes.2012 <- read.csv(file = "nhanes_2011_2012_ch3.csv")

# importing directly from the internet (more reproducible, slower)
temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
download.file(url = "https://edge.sagepub.com/system/files/datasets_7.zip", destfile = temp)
nhanes.2012 <- read.csv(unz(temp, "Datasets/data/nhanes_2011_2012_ch3.csv"))
```

```{r cleanData}
# clean the income, marital status, race, and gun use variables
nhanes.2012.clean <- nhanes.2012 %>% 
  select(INDHHIN2, DMDMARTL, RIDRETH3, AUQ300) %>%

  rename(gun.use = AUQ300) %>% 
  drop_na()

summary(object = nhanes.2012.clean)
table(nhanes.2012.clean$income)
```

```{r incomeGraph}
# Income graph
nhanes.2012.clean %>%
  #drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = income)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Income", y = "Number of observations",
       title = "Income category of survey participants", 
       subtitle = "NHANES 2011-2012 (n = 4,213)") +
```
Yikes! Make a formatting adjustment to be able to read the categories.

3 things that should be in every table/figure title:
- sample size 
- year of data collection
- source of data (this could also go in a footnote)

What is going on with the income variable?

What could we do to fix it?

```{r maritalGraph}
# 2) Marital status
nhanes.2012.clean %>% 
  #drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = marital)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Marital status", y = "Number of observations",
       title = "Marital status of survey participants", 
       subtitle = "NHANES 2011-2012 (n = 4,213)") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```

Interpret the graph: 

```{r raceGraph}
# 3) Race
nhanes.2012.clean %>%   
  #drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race.eth)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Race and ethnicity", y ="Number of observations",
       title = "Race and ethnicity of survey participants",
       subtitle = "NHANES 2011-2012 (n = 4,213)")+
  theme_minimal()
```

Interpret the graph: 

```{r incomeGunGraph}
# Income & gun use graph (with number of observations)
nhanes.2012.clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = income, fill = gun.use)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + # position = "dodge" puts bars side-by-side
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Income category", y = "Number of observations",
       fill = "Ever used gun",
       title = "Ever used gun by income (n = 4,213)", 
       subtitle = "2011-2012 NHANES") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Reds")
```

Interpret the graph: 

```{r incomeGunPercentGraph}
# Income & gun use graph (with percentages)
nhanes.2012.clean %>%
  drop_na(gun.use, income) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = income, fill = gun.use,
             y = 100*(..count..)/sum(..count..))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + # position = "dodge" puts bars side-by-side
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Income category", y = "Percent of observations",
       fill = "Gun use",
       title = "Gun use by income for participants\nof 2011-2012 NHANES (n = 4,213)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Reds")
```

How are these percentages being computed? 



Which bars add up to 100%?




```{r incomeGunPercentCorrected}
# Income & gun use graph (with percentages)
nhanes.2012.clean %>% 
  group_by(income, gun.use) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(income) %>% # the variable you want to add up to 100%
  mutate(percentInc = 100*(n/sum(n))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = income, fill = gun.use,
             y = percentInc)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Income category", y = "Percent within income group", 
       fill = "Ever used gun") +
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Reds")
```

```{r raceGun}
# Race-ethnicity & gun use graph with percentages
nhanes.2012.clean %>%
  drop_na(race.eth, gun.use) %>%

  count() %>% 
  group_by(race.eth) %>% # the variable you want to add to 100%
  mutate(perc.gun.use = 100*(n/sum(n))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race.eth, y = perc.gun.use, fill = gun.use)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Race-ethnicity", y = "Number of observations") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired", name = "Ever used gun")
```
